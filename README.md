Seeing "n/a" means there is no image associated with a radical or its mnemonic.

## Description
This creates and displays a dictionary of essential Japanese words. It displays words next to their definition, hiragana spelling, and kanji composition. Next to each kanji, it displays possible kanji meanings and the kanji's radical. Next to each radical, it displays possible radical meanings and a visual mnemonic to see where in nature the radical could stem from.
<br>
This dictionary could have many uses but I created it to aid me in my quest to learn Japanese.

## Running it locally
**These instructions are only for the SQLite version.**
<br>
Install all dependencies:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Create the databases:
```
python3 words.py
python3 kanji.py
python3 radicals.py
```
Run the application:
```
flask run
```

## Why does it take so long to load?
The current architecture depends on 3 databases. One for 8474 words, their spelling, and their definitions. A second for 1234 kanji, their meanings and their radicals. And a third for 319 radicals, their meanings, and their mnemonics.
<br>
The idea was to avoid creating a one-database app, as some kanji map to the same radical, and some words contain kanji found in other words. In other words, the idea was to avoid data redundancy. So, the initial proposal was to create 3 databases and query them to render the tables. This consumes considerably less memory, but I didn't consider that the latency from querying several tables would significantly slow down the rendering time.
<br>
This is probably because PythonAnywhere doesn't necessarily host the databases in the same drive (probably it does some sort of sharding across a distributed system), making querying from several tables not a responsive architecture (at least under the PythonAnywhere free plan).
<br>
My hypothesis is that creating a single table would consume considerable more space than 3 tables, but querying it would significatively reduce latency times.

## What's next (potentially)
### Styling
Change ï¼ˆ characters for ( .
Styling the tables.
### Features
Adding a search bar.
Think about a computer vision algorithm to identify the non-radical "building blocks" of kanji.
### Deployment
Get a custom domain name.

I developed this using the Kanji alive data, which is publicly available on https://github.com/kanjialive/kanji-data-media.
